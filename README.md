Hello there, here you'll find some more or less usefull stuff I've written over the years.

## What's to Find Here
### strip_comments
A small Python program to display files without lines that are completely commented out. It also has some more advanced features like displaying line numbers. Or Detecting sequences of intermixed empty lines and comments that it just reduces to but one single line for briefity.

It has proven to be quite useful in order to remove comments from configuration files. Many of them consist mainly of empty lines and comment. Oftentimes, seeing the actual config and nothing else is all you want.

See readme in strip_comments directory for details.
